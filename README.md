# Object-Tracker-with-Open-CV-Python
In this I used mobile as a webcam. I don't have webcam in my laptop and hence I used IP Webcam installed in my mobile and with the IP Address I connected.

When object is being tracked, it shows Tracking and if it is lost, it shows Lost

### With TrackerMOSSE
MOSSE is fast but accuracy of tracking is less.
